* Scopes Org-Babel

Put ~ob-scopes.el~ on your load path or load it in your config.

Then you can either add it to the 

#+begin_src elisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '(
     (python . t)
     (shell . t)
     (emacs-lisp . t)
     ; etc...
     (scopes . t)
   ))

#+end_src


Or you can just add it to the list:

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages '(scopes . t))
#+end_src


Doesn't support sessions. You can execute and also export the results.

To stop it from prompting you before each execution put this into your
config:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body)
  (not
   (string= lang "scopes")
   ))
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate #'my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate)
#+end_src

Of course be wary of executing untrusted code on your computer.



** Known Issues

If you have a ~0~ at the end of a block without a newline you will get
a compilation error e.g.:

#+begin_example
  ,#+begin_src scopes
    print 0
  ,#+end_src
#+end_example

Just add a newline like:

#+begin_example
  ,#+begin_src scopes
    print 0
    
  ,#+end_src
#+end_example
